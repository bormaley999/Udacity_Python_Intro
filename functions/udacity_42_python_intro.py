# Udacity Intro to Python
# Section 42 Quiz: Lambda with Filter

"""
Rewrite this code to be more concise by replacing the is_short function
with a lambda expression defined within the call to filter().
"""

cities = ["New York City", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Mountain View", "Denver", "Boston"]

# def is_short(name):
#     return len(name) < 10
# short_cities = list(filter(is_short, cities))

short_cities = list(filter(lambda x: len(x) < 10, cities))  ## Lambda Solution
print(short_cities)
